# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline for Knowledge-Grounded LLMs

A cutting-edge deep learning solution that combines information retrieval with a Question Answering (QA) model to generate context-specific, verifiable, and accurate answers grounded in external knowledge sources.

## Project Title & Short Description

**Title:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline for Knowledge-Grounded LLMs

**Description:** This project constructs a RAG system that uses **Vector Embeddings** and an efficient **Vector Store** (FAISS) to fetch the most relevant document chunks for a given query. These chunks are then used as context by a specialized **Question Answering (QA) Model** (RoBERTa-SQuAD2) to produce an authoritative answer.

## Problem Statement / Goal

The primary objective is to implement a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture to address two critical limitations of standard Large Language Models (LLMs):
1.  **Knowledge Cut-off**: Enabling the model to access and utilize information beyond its initial training data.
2.  **Hallucination**: Grounding the final answer in verified, retrieved context from a custom knowledge base, ensuring factual accuracy and verifiability.

## Tech Stack / Tools Used

This deep learning project leverages core components from the Hugging Face ecosystem for state-of-the-art NLP models:

| Category | Tool / Library | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Deep Learning** | PyTorch (Implied) | Core framework for deep learning and model execution |
| **Model Hosting** | Hugging Face Transformers | Loading pre-trained **Embedding** and **Question Answering** models |
| **Vector Store** | FAISS | Efficient indexing and ultra-fast similarity search/retrieval |
| **Data Handling** | Pandas NumPy | Data manipulation and numerical operations |
| **Similarity** | Scikit-learn | Calculating cosine similarity for retrieval scoring |

## Approach / Methodology

1.  **Knowledge Base Preparation (Inferred)**: The source document is segmented into manageable **chunks** (e.g., paragraphs or sentences).
2.  **Embedding Generation**: An **Embedding Model** is used to convert both the document chunks and the user's query into high-dimensional numerical vectors (embeddings).
3.  **Vector Indexing**: All document embeddings are indexed in the **FAISS Vector Store** to allow for quick, large-scale similarity search.
4.  **Retrieval Phase (R)**: The query embedding is used to search the FAISS index, retrieving the **Top K** most semantically similar document chunks (context).
5.  **Generation Phase (G)**: The retrieved context and the original query are passed to the specialized **`deepset/roberta-base-squad2`** Question Answering model, which extracts the final, precise answer from the provided context.

## Results / Key Findings

* The RAG pipeline successfully integrates information retrieval and language generation into a single system.
* The system demonstrates its ability to answer a user's question by extracting the answer (e.g., "artificial intelligence") directly from the context retrieved from the knowledge base, rather than relying solely on general LLM knowledge.
* This architecture is highly effective for building enterprise-grade, domain-specific chatbots and Q\&A systems.
